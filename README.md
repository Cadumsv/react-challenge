# Jungle Devs - React Challenge #001

## Description

Challenge goal: The purpose of this challenge is to give a general idea of how React works and how you can use it to create simple reactive applications. You’ll be implementing a simplified version of Hapu’s ‘Become a Nanny Share Host’ view. The concepts that you’re gonna apply are:

JSX;
Components, props and state;
Lifecycle Methods;
Responsive design with CSS media-queries;
API calls;
Error handling;
Loading states;
SEO & accessibility;
A/B tests;
Production builds.
Target level: This is an all around challenge that cover both juniors and experience devs based on the depth of how the concepts were applied.

Final accomplishment: By the end of this challenge you'll have a production ready build.
